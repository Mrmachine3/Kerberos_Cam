# Raspberry Pi 3 B+ Surveillance Camera

### Description
This github repository contains project files related to building, programming, and deploying a Raspberyy Pi (RPi) for use as a security camera. Additionally, this unit has Adafruit's [Pan Tilt HAT][1] module that controls the angle of the [PiCamera][2]. The Raspberry Pi will host a Flask webserver that will serve a webpage that displays a live video feed and also a pan-tilt controller that will relay commands back to the Raspberry Pi to control the Pan Tilt servo mechanism. 

### Objectives:
+ Deploy a RPi with the Pan Tilt HAT
+ Record live video feeds
+ Capture pictures at a set interval throughout a 24 hour period
+ Schedule job to archive images
+ Locally control Pan Tilt module 
+ Locally serve a webpage streaming live video feeds
