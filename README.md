## Raspberry Pi Surveillance Camera

### Description
This github repository contains project files related to building, programming, and deploying a Raspberyy Pi (RPi) for use as a security camera. For additional details on hardware, software, and installation instructions, please view my github ***[project wiki][1]***.

#### Hardware Requirements
+ *[Raspberry Pi 3 B+][2]*
+ *[5V 2.5A Switching Power Suppy w/ MicroUSB Cable][3]*
+ *[Raspberry Pi NoIR Camera Board][4]*
+ *[Flex Cable for RPi Camera - 300mm/12"][5]*
+ *[Pimoroni Pan-Tilt HAT for Raspberry Pi][6]* ***NOTE: The servo and frame kit are sold separately
+ *[Mini Pan-Tilt Kit w/ Micro Servos][7]*

Since the *[Raspberry Pi 3 B+][2]* has a GPU that supports wireless local area networks (LANs), you have the option of enabling a Raspberry Pi to connect to your home WiFi signal. Optionally, you could connect an ethernet cable to the Raspberry Pi and connect to the extra LAN port on your home WiFi router.
